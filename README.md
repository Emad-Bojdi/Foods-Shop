# Project Title: Food Shop

## Introduction

Welcome to **Food Shop**, a modern web application designed to provide users with an intuitive platform for exploring a variety of food items and recipes. Built using **Next.js**, this project leverages server-side rendering and static site generation to deliver a fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly experience. The application is structured to allow users to easily navigate through categories, view detailed information about each food item, and access recipes.

### Project Goals

The primary goals of the Food Shop project are:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: To create a seamless and engaging user experience that allows users to explore food items and recipes effortlessly.
- **Dynamic Content**: To provide real-time data fetching and filtering capabilities, enabling users to find food items based on their preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: To ensure that the application is fully responsive and accessible on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Home Page**:
   - The home page serves as the main entry point, showcasing featured food items and providing easy navigation to different sections of the application.

2. **Categories and Menu Pages**:
   - Users can explore food items organized by categories. Each category page displays a list of items, allowing users to filter and select their desired options.

3. **Detailed Item View**:
   - Each food item has a dedicated details page that provides comprehensive information, including ingredients, preparation time, cooking instructions, and more.

4. **API Integration**:
   - The application fetches data from a JSON server, allowing for dynamic content updates and real-time data display. This is facilitated by the `json-server` package, which simulates a RESTful API.

5. **Search and Filter Functionality**:
   - Users can filter food items based on difficulty, cooking time, and other criteria, making it easier to find recipes that suit their needs.
